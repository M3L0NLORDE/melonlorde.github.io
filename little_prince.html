            As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms
            and set out walking once more. <span class="quoted">I felt deeply moved, and stirred.</span> 
            <span class="underlined">It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span> 
            <span class="highlighted">It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span> 
            In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of
            hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: <span class="quoted">"What I 
            see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."</span> 
            As his hips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: 
            <span class="quoted">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to
            a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like
            the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</span> 
            <span class="underlined">And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if
            he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little
            puff of wind...</span>
